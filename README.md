## First Step After Downloading the repo

Don't forget to run

### npm install

After running the server, you will see the primary card component which is being rendered in a grid component.
The Application has been bootstrapped with React, Typescript and Tailwind

## Structure

The structure of the app will be similar to the current one, another folder will be added in the src folder called pages, pages will contain two different layouts which we will use as per our convenience. Also, we will add the functionality of react-router later.

## The Dev Server

Tailwind has been installed in the project by following the guidlines provided at the tailwind website. It suggested to use craco for making changes to the postcss file, so the dev server command in package.json has been changed from react-scripts start to craco start.
